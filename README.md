2. Ratings by Language: * English books have received the vast majority of ratings, approximately 192 million. * English-US books have significantly fewer ratings, around 50 million. * Spanish, English-GB, and French languages show a steep decline in ratings, with Spanish having about 1M, and the others even less.

3. Authors by Language: * Similar to publishers and ratings, English is the dominant language for authors, with about 8.9K authors. * English-US is second with approximately 1.4K authors. * Spanish, English-GB, and French languages have a much smaller number of authors, all under 0.5K.

Knopf, Little, Brown and Company, and Penguin Classics also show significant text review counts, ranging from 0.11M to 0.14M.

7. Top Authors by Ratings: * The top 5 authors by ratings are: * J.R.R. Tolkien (18.75%) * J.K. Rowling (16.23%) * Stephenie Meyer (16.23%) * Dan Brown (11.96%) * Nicholas Sparks (35.02%) - Note: The percentage for Nicholas Sparks seems disproportionately high compared to others given the visual representation and might indicate a data anomaly or a large number of books/ratings attributed.

8. Top Authors by Language: * The top authors by language are: * P.G. Wodehouse (21.39%) * Stephen King (21.39%) * Rumiko Takahashi (17.65%) * Orson Scott Card (18.72%) * Agatha Christie (20.86%) - Note: The percentages sum up to over 100%, suggesting these might represent proportions within specific language categories or are not mutually exclusive counts.

9. Top Authors by Text Review: * The top authors by text review are: * J.K. Rowling (27.67%) * Stephenie Meyer (17.14%) * Markus Zusak (16.04%) * Jodi Picoult (18.78%) * Lois Lowry (20.38%) - Note: Similar to "Top Authors by Language," the percentages sum up to over 100%, indicating these are likely proportions within a specific metric (e.g., within top review counts) rather than overall distribution.

Summary:

The dashboard highlights the overwhelming dominance of English-language publications across all metrics (publishers, ratings, authors, reviews). Penguin Books and Vintage are consistently among the top publishers in terms of quantity and engagement (ratings and reviews). J.K. Rowling, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Stephenie Meyer appear as highly rated and reviewed authors. The "by Language" sections clearly show a significant drop-off in publishing activity for other languages compared to English. There are some minor inconsistencies in the pie chart percentages for "Top Authors by Ratings," "Top Authors by Language," and "Top Authors by Text Review," where the sum of percentages exceeds 100%, suggesting these might represent top individual contributions rather than a full proportional breakdown of all authors.
